In this project, I applied my Power BI skills to analyze a real-world dataset from a telecom company called Databel. The primary objective was to investigate customer churnâ€”a critical concern for subscription-based businesses. My analysis went beyond just identifying the churn rate; I also uncovered the reasons behind customer attrition and devised strategies to reduce it.

Throughout this case study, I created measures and calculated columns to explore the factors contributing to churn. Additionally, I designed visually compelling report pages that effectively communicated my findings. This project provided me with practical experience in using Power BI to tackle a common business challenge.
